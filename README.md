# Shapesmith

Shapesmith is a browser-based 3D modelling application that aims to be powerful, parametric, open and extensible.

To install your own version of Shapesmith on MacOSX or Linux (Ubuntu recommended), please consult the INSTALL.md file. There is also a recent version running on [shapesmith.net](http://shapesmith.net) for you to look at.

If you are upgrading a local installation, please refer to UPGRADe.md

There are two mailing lists:

 * shapesmith-user@googlegroups.com for user questions, suggestions, bug reports etc. 
 * shapesmith-dev@googlegroups.com for developer questions, discussions etc. that are beyond the interest of users.

There is also a twitter account for this project, [@shapesmith](http://www.twitter.com/shapesmith).

Feel free to email me personally at bjnortier@shapesmith.net
