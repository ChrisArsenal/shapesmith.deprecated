Shapesmith 0.2.1
================

Shapesmith is a browser-based 3D design application that aims to be a powerful, parametric applicaiton that is open and extensible.

Although you can design models and export them for printing, Shapesmith is *still a preview* and should be regarded as such.

You can install your own verion of Shapesmith on MacOSX or Linux (Ubuntu recommended), please consult the INSTALL.md file. There is also a recent version running on [shapesmith.net](http://shapesmith.net) for you to look at.

There is a twitter account for this project, [@shapesmith](http://www.twitter.com/shapesmith), and feel free to email me at bjnortier@shapesmith.net for encouragement, questions, bugs etc.
