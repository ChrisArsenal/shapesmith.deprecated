# Install Erlang from source on on Mac OSX

## 10.5.8 (32-bit) Dependencies
These instructions have been verified on a circa-2006 Core Duo (32-bit) MacBook Pro running Leopard (10.5.8). YMMV.

### Erlang (R140B3)
Erlang is the language in which Shapesmith is written.

*Do not install erlang via MacPorts; it is a later non-compatible version!*

A 32-bit compatible version of Erlang/OTP (R140B3) can only be installed from source. It requires these libraries:

* /opt/local/lib/libpng14.14.dylib

* /opt/local/lib/libjpeg.8.dylib

If you don't have them, make symlinks to create them before building:

* sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/libpng14.14.dylib /opt/local/lib/libpng12.0.dylib
* sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/libjpeg.8.dylib /opt/local/lib/libjpeg.7.dylib

To build from source, you must have XCode tools installed from the CD that came with your Mac or from [Appleâ€™s Developer](http://developer.apple.com/ "Apple Developer website") website.

First, download and unpack the source:

* curl -O http://erlang.org/download/otp_src_R14B03.tar.gz
* tar zxvf otp_src_R14B03.tar.gz
* cd otp_src_R14B03

Next, configure Erlang for a 32-bit OS:

* ./configure --enable-hipe --enable-smp-support --enable-threads --enable-kernel-poll

Now build and install (you will be prompted for your password):

* make && sudo make install

Once installed, validate:

* which escript
* escript is /usr/local/bin/escript
